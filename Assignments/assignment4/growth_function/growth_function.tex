\subsection{Question 1}
Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a finite hypothesis set with $|\mathcal{H}|=M$ hypotheses. We wish to derive a bound on the growth function $m_{\mathcal{H}}$. 
 
Since we have a finite hypothesis set it is clear that an upper bound on the growth function is $M$. Further from Definition 2.2 we now that the growth function $m_{\mathcal{H}}(n)$ is bounded by $2^n$. Summarizing these arguments yields that 
\[ m_{\mathbb{H}}(n) \leq \min \lbrace M, 2^n \rbrace. \]   

The VC-dimension, $d_{\text{vc}}(\mathcal{H})$, of a hypothesis set $\mathcal{H}$ is the largest value of $N$ for which $m_{\mathcal{H}}(N)=2^N$. In other words we get that 
\[ M=2^N \Leftrightarrow d_{\text{vc}}(\mathcal{H})=N=\frac{\log M}{\log 2} \] 
\subsubsection*{2}
We have from 1 that $m_{\mathbb{H}}(n) \leq \min \lbrace M, 2^{2n} \rbrace$. We now consider the two possible cases: 

In the case when $M \leq 2^{2n}$ then $m_{\mathbb{H}}(n) \leq M \leq M^2$, where $M^2$ is the bound on $m_{\mathbb{H}}(n)^2$.  

In the case when $M > 2^{2n}$ then $m_{\mathbb{H}}(n) \leq 2^{2n}$, but $2^{2n}$ is in this case also the bound on $m_{\mathbb{H}}(n)^2$. 

All in all we must have that 

\subsection{Question 3}
We wish to prove by induction that 
\[ \sum_{i=0}^d \binom{n}{i} \leq n^d+1. \] 
First we show that it holds for $d=0$. We get 
\[ \sum_{i=0}^0 \binom{n}{i}=\binom{n}{0}=\frac{n!}{0!(n-0)!}=\frac{n!}{n!}=1 < n^0+1=2 \]
We now assume it holds up from $1$ up to $d-1$, and wish to show that it also holds for $d$. We get 
\begin{align*}
\sum_{i=0}^d \binom{n}{i} = \sum_{i=0}^{d-1} \binom{n}{i} + \binom{n}{d}  \stackrel{ind. ass.}{\leq} n^{d-1}+1+\frac{n!}{d!(n-d)!} \leq n^d+1,
\end{align*}
where the last inequality follows by using the properties of the binomial coefficient!
\subsection{Question 4}
From Theorem 2.4 in Learning From Data we have that if $m_{\mathcal{H}}(k) < 2^k$ for some $k$ then it holds for all $N$ that 
\[m_{\mathcal{H}}(N) \leq \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \binom{N}{i}. \]
By using this result together with the result from 3, we get the following bound on $m_{\mathcal{H}}(n)$
\[m_{\mathcal{H}}(n) \leq \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \binom{n}{i} \leq n^{d-1}+1. \] 
\subsubsection*{5}
By using the bound from 4 we get the following VC generalization bound by inserting into Theorem 2.5 of Learning From Data
\[E_{\text{out}}(g) \leq E_{\text{in}}(g) + \sqrt{ \frac{8}{N} \ln \frac{4m_{\mathcal{H}}(2n)}{\delta}} \leq E_{\text{in}}(g) + \sqrt{ \frac{8}{N} \ln \frac{4 \left((2n)^{d-1}+1 \right)}{\delta}} \] 
Since the bound is derived from using binomial coefficients we must have that $d \leq n$. Otherwise the following quantity is not meaningful (negative factorials are not defined) 
\[ \binom{n}{d}=\frac{n!}{d!(n-d)!}\]
