\subsection{Question 1}
Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a finite hypothesis set with $|\mathcal{H}|=M$ hypotheses. 

Because we have a finite hypothesis set, we know that an upper bound on the growth function is $M$.

We also know that the growth function $m_{\mathcal{H}}(n)$ is bounded by $2^n$ from definition 2.2 (learning from data book).
So from these arguments we can say that it holds:
\[ m_{\mathbb{H}}(n) \leq \min \lbrace M, 2^n \rbrace. \]

\subsection{Question 3}
We do know have from question 1 that $m_{\mathbb{H}}(n) \leq \min \lbrace M, 2^{2n} \rbrace$. 

So we have to consider 2 cases:

For the case when $M \leq 2^{2n}$ then $m_{\mathbb{H}}(n) \leq M \leq M^2$, where $M^2$ is the bound on $m_{\mathbb{H}}(n)^2$. 

And for the case $M > 2^{2n}$ then $m_{\mathbb{H}}(n) \leq 2^{2n}$, but $2^{2n}$ is in this case also the bound on $m_{\mathbb{H}}(n)^2$. 

So over all we must have:
\[m_{\mathbb{H}}(2n)\leq m_{\mathbb{H}}(n)^2 .\] 


\subsection{Question 4}
Since I haven't done the prove before, here I have done the prove by induction:
\[ \sum_{i=0}^d \binom{n}{i} \leq n^d+1. \] 
First show that it holds for $d=0$: 
\[ \sum_{i=0}^0 \binom{n}{i}=\binom{n}{0}=\frac{n!}{0!(n-0)!}=\frac{n!}{n!}=1 < n^0+1=2 \]
Now we want to show that is also holds for $1$ up to $d-1$:
\begin{align*}
\sum_{i=0}^d \binom{n}{i} = \sum_{i=0}^{d-1} \binom{n}{i} + \binom{n}{d} {\leq} n^{d-1}+1+\frac{n!}{d!(n-d)!} \leq n^d+1,
\end{align*}
Now we want to derive the bound on $m_{\mathcal{H}}(n)$.
From theorem 2.4 (Learning From Data) we know that if $m_{\mathcal{H}}(k) < 2^k$ for some  value $k$ then for all $N$:
\[m_{\mathcal{H}}(N) \leq \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \binom{N}{i}. \]
Now we use the result of the induction above and the theorem 2.4 from the book, so that we end up on the following bound:
\[m_{\mathcal{H}}(n) \leq \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \binom{n}{i} \leq n^{d-1}+1. \] 
\subsection{Question 5}
Now using the bound from 4 we will get the following VC generalization bound, by inserting it into theorem 2.5 from the book (learning from data):
\[E_{\text{out}}(g) \leq E_{\text{in}}(g) + \sqrt{ \frac{8}{N} \ln \frac{4m_{\mathcal{H}}(2n)}{\delta}} \leq E_{\text{in}}(g) + \sqrt{ \frac{8}{N} \ln \frac{4 \left((2n)^{d-1}+1 \right)}{\delta}} \] 

\subsection{Question 6}
Since the bound is derived from using binomial coefficients we must have that $d \leq n$. Since negative factorials are not defined which would not be meaningful. 
\[ \binom{n}{d}=\frac{n!}{d!(n-d)!}\]
