Since we work with a bernulli distribution here we have probability $p$ for showing up and not showing up $1-p$
So from the question we have that 0.95 passengers show up while ther is a 0.05 percentage who is not showing up.
Also we have 2 Events, and as described we seem to want both Events happening at the same time so $P_p(A\wedge B)$:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Event A: An i.i.d sample of 10000 flight reservations, and 95\% show up in them
	\item Event B:An i.i.d sample of 100 flights, on which all passengers show up (100 of 99)	
\end{itemize}

We know that the 2 Events are independent which means $P_p(A\wedge B) = P_p(A)P_(B)$.
Where $p$ is the probability of a passenger is showing up for his reservation.

Further we would need to multiplicate those 2 probabilities etc.

But I ended up not doing this exercise, any input if the start is right or not would be still appreciated.
