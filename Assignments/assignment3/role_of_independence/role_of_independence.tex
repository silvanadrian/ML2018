So for this question we need to design an example of distributed but \textit{dependent} Bernoulli variables, for which have to hold following condition:
\begin{align}
	P\left(|\mu - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i|\geq \frac{1}{2}\right) = 1
\end{align}
By dependent meaning the next random variable in line is dependent on the one before:
\begin{align}
	X_i,X_{i+1} ...
\end{align}
A good example for that would be markov chains.
So we say that conditionally:
\begin{align}
	P(X_{i+1}|X_i)
\end{align}
otherwise I might misunderstood something totally.
