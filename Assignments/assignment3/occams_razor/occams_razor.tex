\subsection{Question 1}
From the definition of the assignment text we can say that the size of $\Sigma_d$ is the number of ways to choose $d$ elements from $\Sigma$ with replacement.
Which means that:
\begin{align}
|\Sigma_d| = |\Sigma|^d = 27^d 
\end{align}

There is a on to one mapping of the elements of $\mathcal{H}_d$ and the power set $\mathcal{P}(\Sigma_d)$ of $\Sigma_d$:
\begin{align}
|\mathcal{H}_d| = |\mathcal{P}(\Sigma_d)| = 2^{|\Sigma_d|}=2^{27^d}
\end{align}

$\mathcal{H}_d$ in this case is finite, so we can use $\textbf{Theorem 3.2}$ for concluding with probability $1 - \delta$ for all $h \in \mathcal{H}_d$:
\begin{align}
L(h) \leq \hat{L}(h, S) + \sqrt{\frac{\ln \frac{|\mathcal{H}_d|}{\delta}}{2n}} = \hat{L}(h, S) + \sqrt{\frac{\ln \frac{2^{27^d}}{\delta}}{2n}}
\end{align}
here $S$ is a labeled sample of strings from $\Sigma_d$, and $n$ is here $|S|$.


And we see now that the size of $\mathcal{H}_d$ grows exponentially with the size of $d$:
\begin{align}
\sqrt{\frac{\ln \frac{2^{27^d}}{\delta}}{2n}}
\end{align}

%Question2
\subsection{Question 2}
Let $\mathcal{H}$ be defined as in the assignment text. 
For this questions we would use \textbf{Theorem 3.3}:
\begin{align}
L(h) \leq \hat{L}(h,S) + \sqrt{\frac{\ln \frac{1}{p(h)\delta}}{2n}}
\end{align}

From here I didn't know how exactly to proceed, any input would be appreciated. 


% Question 3
\subsection{Question 3}
Well one of the trade-offs will be that the longer the strings get the term will grow exponentially, so there has to be found some middle ground to not let it grow too large.
